## ConfiGUI

ConfiGUI is a mod in development for Kerbal Space Program. Its aim is to provide users an easier way to adjust settings for a given mod, without forcing mod authors to write their own plugins.
It will allow mod authors to write their own setting configs, which will be used to give their mod a toolbar button. Users can then edit their settings there, and save them to the .cfg file.
Additional features include providing a credits tab for a mod and automatic installation checking, to warn users if they've installed the mod incorrectly and log useful information for mod authors.

The project was born out of a prototype made for [Promised Worlds](https://github.com/PromisedWorlds/PromisedWorlds), but we wanted to make this something that could benefit all planet mods (and mods of any kind).

It is currently being developed by [averageksp](https://github.com/averageksp/) and [levitato5594](https://github.com/levitato5594/).
